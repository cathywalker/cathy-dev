      <h1>React Projects</h1>
      <div>I began developing in React in 2015. I was getting lots of Freelance work and wanted to give my clients the latest technology so as best to future proof their site. In 2016 I began to work for a company again, that was client based, that was able to secure even more work and most of those websites they requested were built in React. Since then I have kept up to date with all the changes to the Library.
