      <div>
          I have been a Professional Web Developer for 17 years. I have had a passion for Computers and Technology since I was a child and went to my father's office which was filled with computers and programmers.

        <p>I knew my future lay in Web Development as I loved learning about the techonolgy so much. Since then I have kept up to date with latest Libraries, Frameworks and changes in languages. My main technolgies at the minute are React/TypeScript, SCSS and Tailwind.</p>
